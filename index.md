# Welcome to My Dev Blog

My name is Kyle Heaven, and this is my dev blog. Currently, I am in the **12th grade**, and I am learning not just at my home school Medgar Evers College Preperatory School, but also at the [Brooklyn Steam Center](http://brooklynsteamcenter.org) as a Full-Stack Development student. Feel free to read my blog, or if you want, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/Kjh451672) account.
