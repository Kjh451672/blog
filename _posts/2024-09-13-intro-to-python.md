# My Enticing Experience With Python

Have you ever done anything so repetitive, that it was almost hypnotizing? When I was first introduced to Python, which was around late november 2023, it was very fun. But considering the first project that we used it for was a text-based adventure game, it was also very tedious. Once I got into the flow of it though, it was very…enticing to say the least.

## Data Types

Prior to learning Python, the first coding language I ever learned was Javascript. Granted, considering the teacher I learned it from, I don’t believe I was able to grasp the concept very well. However, if I hadn’t learned Javascript, it would have been a lot harder to understand Python, considering the two are very similar coding languages, with similar data types.

When I say data types, I mean that in reference to variables. Variables are quick ways to store a specific data type, like a string (text), a boolean (true or false), an integer (whole number), or a float (decimal number). Once we learned the “basics” we were able to apply them to our first game: a text-based adventure game.

## Text-Based Adventure Game

A text-based adventure game is a game with a premade set of rules, along with a linear story. Your options are presented to you in forms of sentences, where you have to type in one of the options presented to you. It was at this point where I realized that this project would not only be repetitive, but also very tedious.

Now THIS particular step was actually in the later stages of “development”, but one of the things we added to our text-based adventure games was something called ASCII Art. ASCII is sort of like pixel art, but it uses text to create words in interesting styles like in the picture above, or picture of objects out of keys like these ( * ` ~ - _, etc.).

To even be able to create “art” like this through coding, we had to print out each individual line. Speaking of lines, before we could even start ANY of this, we had to plan out what path we wanted the user to follow when playing the game. So to do this, we had to map out our story line in google charts.

Once we had the general concept of each of our games down, we got into the nitty gritty stuff. To help keep a general structure with our game, we had to put each and every branch or segment of our game into functions. Functions allow us to store basically endless lines of code. They can also be called at any time, allowing us to go back and forth between the same “pathways”.

These “pathways” represent the different choices that we present to the user whenever they come across a certain segment or crossroad in the story. Previous choices can sometimes influence your future ones in these sorts of games. A good example of a game that pulled off this dynamic well was the Minecraft Story Mode series.

## Wrapping Things Up

Anyway, back to the pathways. As I said before, each pathway had a different function created for it. We used “elif” statements or “else if” statements to register the input for the different choices. For example, if you were given the options to either “paint your house blue” or “paint your house green”, it would wait for you to choose one of the options before executing the code.

For this project we had to create a scenario with at least 4 different endings. You can probably imagine that this took a lot of time. But combine all the choices with some ASCII Art, a load of choices, and a mix of funny dialogue and dark humor, and you have your very own text based adventure game.

After seeing the whole thing come together, it felt nice. Yes, in reality it ended up being very short, but it was still so satisfying to see the whole thing come together. It wasn't until I started writing this blog until I realized that coding is just like a text-based adventure game. It's a lot of trial and error, trying things out that you don’t think are possible, until you’re surprised by the output you didn’t expect.
