# My Everyday Routine

I'd figure that for this update, i'd talk less about what I *can* do, and more about what I do. Specifically, for this month's posts. post I simply want to talk about my daily routine, from when I get up to when I get to bed. And who knows, maybe you'll see some things that I do that are similar to your routine.


## Getting Out of Bed
My day starts with me waking up at 5:45 in the morning. Before you say anything about how **absurdly** early this is, I have several reasons for this. Those reasons being:

- Giving myself those extra 15 minutes to "wake up"
- The pulls up right around the time when I leave
- I can take my time when getting ready
- I just like getting up early

Because my brother has to get up early to go to work, I unintentionally end up getting up around 2:50 sometimes, and staying awake until the general time I'm supposed to get up. I understand that this is  **extremely** unhealthy, but in my defense...I can't help it.


## Breakfast and Brushing
My typical first meal for the day is normally a warm bowl of cereal. Most people would boil the milk separately then pour it over the cereal. What I do is what most people would consider "cursed", which is fill the bowl with milk first, pop it in the microwave, and then pour in the cereal after.
If I ever have anything else for breakfast, it's either something else like a bagel or some tea, or leftovers from the previous day. Once I'm done with breakfast, it's a trip to the bathroom to brush my teeth and clean my retainers.


## Dressed To Impress (No one)
After I finish up in the bathroom, it's time to get dressed. At least, not before using some lotion and spraying some deodorant that is. Since at the time i'm writing this i'm still going to school, my choice of wardrobe is very, **VERY** minuscule. It consists of a typical school pants, and a typical school shirt with the school emblem on it.

Depending on the day of the week, I tend to alternate with just two pairs of shoes.The reason for this is that sneakers are better for gym class than Nike dunks. I found that out the hard way. Then depending on the weather, I pop on a sweater and/or a jacket, and head out the door, where I make my way to the Brooklyn S.T.E.A.M. Center. 


## STEAMing Into The Day
Out of all the seniors, I am usually the first person to arrive, which is roughly at 7:30. Now S.T.E.A.M. doesn't start until 8:30, which leaves me an hour to pass the time with whatever I need to take care of. If I've been on top of all of my work, I'll normally play games on my Nintendo Switch. Once the other students start to arrive, then I'll ironically act like a normal person for once and socialize.

Once it hits 8:30, my day at the STEAM Center begins. You may have inferred that I am a Full-Stack Developer, that is if you've seen my recent posts. At the time of writing this blog, we are currently learning how to program AI and utilize **Machine Learning** to help train them. The process is less coding and more waiting around for the AI to finish training itself. Depending on the data set and how good your internet is, the time may vary. But, it is still a very long and tedious process.

## Getting Schooled
At 10:50, we clean up for the day, and all of the students get driven back to thier home schools. I have a personal gripe with the time that we get out, because every time that we get back to school, I'm not only already late, but have to make a trek all the way up to the top floor, **EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.** What makes it worse is that I genuinely lose half of the effort that I put into the day as soon as I enter the building.

## Closing The Curtains
My day once I reach back at my home school is the same as any default school day, which I'm fairly sure most of you reading this understand so i'm just going to skip on over. If it's Monday, then I stay back for chamber choir, and if not then I just head straight home. From there, it's a combination of getting my homework done, eating dinner, taking out the trash or washing the dishes, showering, and hopping in bed waiting for the inevitability of what is tomorrow. Some days are better than others, and I hope that your days are just as good as mine can be.
